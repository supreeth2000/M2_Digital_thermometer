# M2_Digital_thermometer

* A digital thermometer is used to verify a smart temperature transmitter under flowing conditions and a successful calibration of the smart temperature transmitter. Portable electronic thermometers (PETs) are designed to measure temperature in a RTD-type thermowell using a thermistor or RTD probe.
